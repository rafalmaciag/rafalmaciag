# Overview

Event Modeling is a new paradigm for information systems development. It destroys the missconception created by Agile era, were systems were meant to be so 'complex' that require probe-sense-respond practice, thus implying that estimates are impractical.

With Event Modeling you will be able to develop:

* Naturally & simply with business, having no bias or incomplete information on requirements. Communicate with no technical vocabulary (no aggregates, tables, transactions etc.)

* With right open-closed principle, where you add new software and let old to exinct. Providing *zero data loss* and *more scalable* systems.

* Faster and repeatable. Giving ability to decide on lead times of deliverables.

## What you will learn

### Hard skills

* How to build Event Sourced Systems.
* How to implement commands, events, stream writers, command handlers, event handlers,
* How to implement read-models and projections
* How change management works with ES systems including versioning
* How to avoid common mistakes and pitfalls

### Soft skills

* How to communicate with business and do estimations
* How to explore the 'unkowns' and how to construct complete solution blue-print before imlementation

## Expected audience

* Team Leaders, Architects and developers.
* Project Manager/Owners with technical background.
