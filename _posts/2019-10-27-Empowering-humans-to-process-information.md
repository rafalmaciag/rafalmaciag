# Did you ever have an idea of an App or IT System, you wanted to create?

No matter if you build a **startup** or work as a **Product Owner** in a bank - Soon after you'll realize that you need to answer some hard questions:

* How much will the app **cost** to develop?
* How to **describe** your idea to developers with right **completness** check?
* How to get them and start working with them?
* How to be independent? How to protect your **Intelectual Property**?

## What's worse, most of current SoftwareHouses won't teach you all off the above.

* They will tell you the price, but won't tell you how to calculate it. (Because it's from experience... really??)
* They will describe your idea in meaningfull way, but won't let you do it. Or developers will do it on their own and even won't show it you, as "*you won't understand...*" - Excel with tasks is enough, right???
* They will talk to developers on your behalf. Or in a better case you will be able to talk to them and try to understand what they are saying... *UUuuuhhhhh* Having no common surface for productive discussion.
* Finally they will try to make a vendor-lock, so that you can only develop new features with them. Moving the solution anywheres else would be simply way to risky.

## How long it takes to understand? Is it that hard?

* It's easy, people were telling stories for ages, and it's the very our nature that we could transfer knoledge from genaration to generation.
* It takes 1-3 days - if you want to describe your precise solution (medium system/retail/point-of-sales/inventory/etc...)
* It takes 1 week - if you need also to discover other solutions and potential problems

## How to do it, now?

1. Get familiar with EventModeling if you need model the solution.
2. Get familiar with EventStorming if you need also to discover other solutions and potential problems.
3. Estimate yourself from EventModeling blue-print
4. Ask for developers and pay for results (from EventModeling's slices), not **time**.


Have you heard this:

`I don't know how much this will cost, let's do T&M (time based costs)`

SoftwareHouse would then provide enigneers (maybe even teams) that would help you build solution, and you will pay... for time, having no guarantee on results.

We need a common workspace for collaboration that allows us to describe clearly our thoughts.


## Or as a developer - Did you ever want to earn based on your results with no bias?

## Then we need developers to
