# Human reasoning driven software development

Building almost any product or startup involves developing IT systems. Let's imagine that we all can magically build them, without any hassle. How then would we tell our product/business story?

```
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
```

## Can you hear the fight?

Creation of **idea/concept** needs common language, structure, surface for communication, for collision, for fight, for discussion. We humans needs to work collaboratevly to make great things.
During my workshops I've discovered, that efficient communication distinguishes building blocks into:

- Facts
- Conculsions
- Intentions
- Actions

With those building block you can construct your thoughts. Let's examine:

1. Based on sets of streams of facts we derive concusions (project).
2. Those concusions can then help deriving more concusions.
3. Some of concusions enable availability of certain intentions. With intention we expect that after execution of action (that may or not be know then) certain fact will take place.
4. If we then select an intention, this triggers a decisition and thus action.
5. Then the story repeats. Action triggers some facts that are about to happen. (are expected because of intention).

## Let's five some example, so that above abstraction is less, well... abstract ;)

*Example*

## Now let's see visually all our thoughts and reasoning. 

If we do it, we'll find the right space for discussion, collisions, for fight and creation.

*Pickture of EventModeling*

As you see from the example, those building blocks seems to be suprisingly fitting the definition of natural construction of a thought. 

1. Facts are just events in information systems.
2. Conclusions are just the view on facts. 
3. Intentions is the expression of future oportunities based on conclusions
4. Actions are just commands.

It's amazing, but what what I've just laied down, is essentially an information system. Unlike any other, this aproach mimics natural thinking, visualizes it, allowing collaboration between people to happen. Can you feel the atmosfere where everybody is empowered to easily contribute? With human narrative, communication and collisions.  

This blue-print precisely describes information system (with minor details, that I haven't covered). The precision is so high, that we can imedietly estimate costs of development: If we see building blocks of information system and dependencies, we can quantify complexity. Coding of such building block is a repeatable process. 

## Reasoning in stories is not limited to a deterministic process, it can be flexible with A.I.

When working in such a space, it's us to decide, and we can have influcene like no time before:
* we can decide which part of the busiess story is important to busiess - thus moving to impact mapping
* we can almost decide on time-to-market, because development is finnally fixed priced. It's scallable.
* we can test meany hipothesis, because as humans we do it constantly in our minds and we are mirroring this thinking.
* further, we can decide to use ML instead of traditional deterministics business rules to trigger actions, or show conclusions.
* we can even design whole systems based on ML that learn and adapt, just because we mimic human thinking.
